# Linked Data Warehouse

This repo contains the queries referenced in the publication _"Improving lifecycle query in integrated toolchains using linked data and MQTT-based data warehousing"_. Some additional queries developed as part of the process are
available as exported Insomnia REST client requests (under `src/queries/misc/insomnia/`).

The rest of the code has been submitted to the Eclipse Lyo project under the following bug reports:

* https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=513207
